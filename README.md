Heart Disease Prediction Using Python  

Heart disease prediction using Python involves building a machine learning model to assess an individual’s risk of heart disease based on various health parameters. This project typically uses medical datasets, such as the UCI Heart Disease dataset, which includes features like age, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, heart rate, and lifestyle factors.

Key Steps:  
1. Data Collection – Obtain a dataset with relevant health attributes.  
2. Data Preprocessing – Clean and preprocess the data (handling missing values, normalization, encoding categorical variables).  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Visualize correlations and identify key risk factors.  
4. Feature Selection – Select the most relevant features to improve model accuracy.  
5. Model Selection & Training – Use machine learning algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Neural Networks.  
6. Model Evaluation – Assess performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.  
7. Deployment (Optional) – Deploy the model using Flask, Django, or a cloud service for real-time predictions.  

This project can help in early detection and prevention of heart disease, aiding healthcare professionals in decision-making.
